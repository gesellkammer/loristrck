LORISTRCK
=========

`loristrck` is a wrapper for the C++ partial-tracking library Loris.

It is written in cython and targets python 3 (>= 3.8 at the moment). The source of the library is included 
as part of the project and does not need to be installed previously.


C++ Library Dependencies:
  * fftw3_

.. _fftw3: http://www.fftw.org


Additional Python Module Dependencies:
  * Cython
  * NumPy
  * pysndfile + libsndfile
  * sounddevice to be able to play samples (see loristrck_play)


Optional dependencies:
  * csound (in order to play ``.mtx`` files, as generated by loristrck_pack)

Installation
============

Install from source
-------------------

Install dependencies (see each platform):
  * fftw
  * libsndfile

::

   git clone https://github.com/gesellkammer/loristrck 
   cd loristrck 
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install .


OSX using homebrew
------------------

``loristrck`` is a C/C++ extension for python 3 (>=3.6) and needs a compiler present. 
It is developed in linux but should work in macOS and Windows without problems

::

    brew install fftw
    brew install libsndfile
    pip install numpy cython
    pip install loristrck


Linux
-----

::

    apt install libfftw3-dev libsndfile1-dev
    pip install numpy cython
    pip install loristrck


Windows
-------

* Install ``libsndfile`` from http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/#Download
* Install ``fftw3`` from http://www.fftw.org/install/windows.html
* Download the 32-bit binary package. Unzip to a directory of your choice. 
  Suggestion: ``C:\\src``. You should have then a folder ``C:\\src\\fftw`` 
* Put that directory in your PATH (Control Panel/System/Advanced/Environmental Variables/)
  
  ``python setup.py install -LC:\\my\\path\\to\\fftw``


At the command-line, do::

  git clone https://github.com/gesellkammer/loristrck 
  cd loristrck 
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  pip install .

Otherwise, install it via pip::

   pip install numpy cython
   pip install loristrck

(this assumes that you put the fftw3 source under ``C:\\src``)


Usage
=====

.. code-block:: python

   import loristrck as lt

   samples, sr = lt.sndreadmono("/path/to/sndfile.wav")
   partials = lt.analyze(samples, sr, resolution=60)
   # partials is a python list of numpy arrays
   # select a subset of most significant partials
   selected, noise = lt.select(partials, mindur=0.02, maxfreq=12000, minamp=-60, minbp=2)
   # print each partial as data
   for partial in selected:
       print(partial)
   # plot selected partials
   lt.plot_partials(selected)
   # now resynthesize both parts separately 
   lt.partials_render(selected, outfile="selected.wav")
   lt.partials_render(noise, outfile="noise.wav")
   

Each partial will be a numpy array of shape = (numbreakpoints, 5)
with the columns::

  time, frequency, amplitude, phase, bandwidth


See the example scripts in `bin` for more complete examples
