Welcome to Loris.

Loris is an open source C++ class library implementing analysis,
manipulation, and synthesis of digitized sounds using the Reassigned
Bandwidth-Enhanced Additive Sound Model.

For more information about Loris and the Reassigned Bandwidth-Enhanced
Additive Model, contact the developers at loris@cersloundgroup.org, or
visit them at http://www.cerlsoundgroup.org/Loris/.

The primary distribution point for Loris is SourceForge
(http://loris.sourceforge.net) and its mirrors.

Loris is free software. Please see the file COPYING for details.

For documentation, please see the files in the doc subdirectory.

For a list of major changes to Loris, organized by release number,
please see the file NEWS.

INSTALLATION: 

For generic configuration and installation instructions, see
the file INSTALL.

In order to compile and link the Loris library and scripting extensions,
you will need a modern, reasonably standard-compliant C++ compiler (and
linker, etc.). To build scripting extensions, such as the Python module,
you will also need SWIG, a tool that connects programs written in C and
C++ with a variety of high-level programming languages, available at
www.swig.org 

For best performance, you should also install the FFTW Fourier transform
library, available at www.fftw.org. Mac OS X users see note below. FFTW
is covered by its own license and copyright, and is entirely separate
from Loris. FFTW is not required to build or use Loris.


MacOS INSTALLATION:

Loris can be built using the standard GNU tools from a Terminal window
under Mac OS X (Darwin), follow the instructions for the standard
distribution. You will, of course, need the developers' tools, available
from Apple, in order to compile Loris (or anything else) under OS X. It
is also possible to build Loris using Xcode under OS X.

NOTE: By default, FFTW builds and installs only static libraries under
Mac OS X. Loris needs to link against the dynamic FFTW library. You need
to explicitly enable dynamic linking when building FFTW so that the
dynamic (shared) library is built.
