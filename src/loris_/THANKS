Loris is developed by Kelly Fitz and Lippold Haken at the CERL Sound
Group (http://www.cerlsoundgroup.org).

and Ken Turkowski, by way of Arun Chandra. 

Platform-neutral fast Fourier transform implementation provided by
Takuya OOURA, http://momonga.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~ooura/fft.html.

Key parts of the development of Loris were initiated during an invited

Dartmouth College in 1996, graciously arranged by Larry Polansky.

Ulrike Axen provided an optimal collating algorithm, used in the Distiller.
