<h3>Description</h3>

The <strong>Loris</strong> unit generators, <strong>lorisread</strong>,
<strong>lorisplay</strong>, and <strong>lorismorph</strong>, perform
<em>Bandwidth-Enhanced</em> additive reconstruction of a sound specified
by a set of partials obtained from a <em>Reassigned Bandwidth-Enhanced
Analysis</em> performed using the <strong>Loris</strong> software.
<p>

<strong>lorisread</strong> imports a set of bandwidth-enhanced partials
from a SDIF-format data file, applying control-rate frequency,
amplitude, and bandwidth scaling envelopes, and stores the modified
partials in memory.
<p>

<strong>lorismorph</strong> morphs two stored sets of bandwidth-enhanced
partials and stores a new set of partials representing the morphed
sound. The morph is performed by linearly interpolating the parameter
envelopes (frequency, amplitude, and bandwidth, or noisiness) of the
bandwidth-enhanced partials according to control-rate
frequency, amplitude, and bandwidth morphing functions.
<p>

<strong>lorisplay</strong> renders a stored set of bandwidth-enhanced
partials using the method of <em>Bandwidth-Enhanced Additive
Synthesis</em> implemented in the <strong>Loris</strong> software,
applying control-rate frequency, amplitude, and bandwidth scaling
envelopes.


<p>
For more information about sound morphing and manipulation using
<strong>Loris</strong> and the <em>Reassigned Bandwidth-Enhanced
Additive Model</em>, visit the <strong>Loris</strong> web site at <a
href="www.cerlsoundgroup.org/Loris/">www.cerlsoundgroup.org/Loris/</a>


<h3>Initialization</h3>

<p><em>ifilcod</em> &#8211; integer or character-string denoting a
control-file derived from reassigned bandwidth-enhanced analysis of an
audio signal. An integer denotes the suffix of a file
<em>loris.sdif</em> (e.g. <em>loris.sdif.1</em>); a character-string (in
double quotes) gives a filename, optionally a full pathname. If not
fullpath, the file is sought first in the current directory, then in the
one given by the environment variable <strong>SADIR</strong> (if defined).
The reassigned bandwidth-enhanced data file contains breakpoint
frequency, amplitude, noisiness, and phase envelope values organized for
bandwidth-enhanced additive resynthesis. The control data must conform
to one of the SDIF formats that can be interpreted using the
<strong>Loris</strong> library for sound modeling and manipulation.
Memory usage depends on the size of the files involved, which are read
and held entirely in memory during computation but are shared by
multiple calls. 
</p>

<p> <strong>Loris</strong> stores partials in SDIF RBEP frames. Each
RBEP frame contains one RBEP matrix, and each row in a RBEP matrix
describes one breakpoint in a <strong>Loris</strong> partial. A RBEL
frame containing one RBEL matrix describing the labeling of the partials
may precede the first RBEP frame in the SDIF file. The RBEP and RBEL
frame and matrix definitions are included in the SDIF file's header. In
addition to RBEP frames, <strong>Loris</strong> can also read and write
SDIF 1TRC frames.  Since 1TRC frames do not represent
bandwidth-enhancement or the exact timing of <strong>Loris</strong>
breakpoints, their use is not recommended. 1TRC capabilities are
provided to allow interchange with programs that are unable to handle
RBEP frames.
</p>

<p> <em>istoreidx</em>, <em>ireadidx</em>, <em>isrcidx</em>,
<em>itgtidx</em> are labels that identify a stored set of
bandwidth-enhanced partials. <strong>lorisread</strong> imports partials
from a SDIF file and stores them with the integer label
<em>istoreidx</em>. <strong>lorismorph</strong> morphs sets of partials
labeled <em>isrcidx</em> and <em>itgtidx</em>, and stores the resulting
partials with the integer label <em>istoreidx</em>.
<strong>lorisplay</strong> renders the partials stored with the label
<em>ireadidx</em>. The labels are used only at initialization time, and
may be reused without any cost or benefit in efficiency, and without
introducing any interaction between instruments or instances. 
</p>


<p><em>ifadetime</em> (optional) &#8211; In general, partials exported
from <strong>Loris</strong> begin and end at non-zero amplitude. In
order to prevent artifacts, it is very often necessary to fade the
partials in and out, instead of turning them abruptly on and off.
Specification of a non-zero <em>ifadetime</em> causes partials to fade
in at their onsets and to fade out at their terminations. This is
achieved by adding two more breakpoints to each partial: one
<em>ifadetime</em> seconds before the start time and another
<em>ifadetime</em> seconds after the end time. (However, no breakpoint
will be introduced at a time less than zero. If necessary, the onset
fade time will be shortened.) The additional breakpoints at the partial
onset and termination will have the same frequency and bandwidth as the
first and last breakpoints in the partial, respectively, but their
amplitudes will be zero. The phase of the new breakpoints will be
extrapolated to preserve phase correctness. If no value is specified,
<em>ifadetime</em> defaults to zero. Note that the fadetime may not be
exact, since the partial parameter envelopes are sampled at the control
rate (krate) and indexed by <em>ktimpnt</em> (see below), and not by
real time. 
</p>


<h3>Performance</h3>

<strong>lorisread</strong> reads pre-computed <em>Reassigned
Bandwidth-Enhanced</em> analysis data from a file stored in SDIF format,
as described above. The passage of time through this file is specified
by <em>ktimpnt</em>, which represents the time in seconds.
<em>ktimpnt</em> must always be positive, but can move forwards or
backwards in time, be stationary or discontinuous, as a pointer into the
analysis file. <em>kfreqenv</em> is a control-rate transposition factor:
a value of 1 incurs no transposition, 1.5 transposes up a perfect fifth,
and .5 down an octave. <em>kampenv</em> is a control-rate scale factor
that is applied to all partial amplitude envelopes. <em>kbwenv</em> is a
control-rate scale factor that is applied to all partial bandwidth or
noisiness envelopes. The bandwidth-enhanced partial data is stored in
memory with a specified label for future access by another generator.
</p>




<p><strong>lorismorph</strong> generates a set of bandwidth-enhanced
partials by morphing two stored sets of partials, the source and target
partials, which may have been imported using <strong>lorisread</strong>,
or generated by another unit generator, including another instance of
<strong>lorismorph</strong>. The morph is performed by interpolating the
parameters of corresponding (labeled) partials in the two source sounds
(for a full explanation, visit the <strong>Loris</strong> web site at <a
href="www.cerlsoundgroup.org/Loris/">www.cerlsoundgroup.org/Loris/</a>).
The sound morph is described by three control-rate morphing envelopes.
<em>kfreqmorphenv</em> describes the interpolation of partial frequency
values in the two source sounds. When <em>kfreqmorphenv</em> is 0,
partial frequencies are obtained from the partials stored at
<em>isrcidx</em>. When <em>kfreqmorphenv</em> is 1, partial frequencies
are obtained from the partials at <em>itgtidx</em>. When
<em>kfreqmorphenv</em> is between 0 and 1, the partial frequencies are
interpolated between corresponding source and target partials.
Interpolation of partial amplitudes and bandwidth (noisiness)
coefficients are similarly described by <em>kampmorphenv</em> and
<em>kbwmorphenv</em>.
</p>

<p><strong>lorisplay</strong> implements signal reconstruction using
Bandwidth-Enhanced Additive Synthesis. The control data is obtained from
a stored set of bandwidth-enhanced partials imported from an SDIF file
using <strong>lorisread</strong> or constructed by another unit
generator such as <strong>lorismorph</strong>. <em>kfreqenv</em> is
a control-rate transposition factor: a value of 1 incurs no
transposition, 1.5 transposes up a perfect fifth, and .5 down an octave.
<em>kampenv</em> is a control-rate scale factor that is applied to all
partial amplitude envelopes. <em>kbwenv</em> is a control-rate scale
factor that is applied to all partial bandwidth or noisiness envelopes.
The bandwidth-enhanced partial data is stored in memory with a specified
label for future access by another generator.


<p>This implementation of the <strong>Loris</strong> unit generators was
written by Kelly Fitz. It is patterned after a prototype implementation of the
<strong>lorisplay</strong> unit generator written by Corbin
Champion, and based on the method of
<em>Bandwidth-Enhanced Additive Synthesis</em> and on the sound morphing
algorithms implemented in the <strong>Loris</strong> library for sound
modeling and manipulation. For more information about
<em>Bandwidth-Enhanced Additive Synthesis</em>, <em>Reassigned
Bandwidth-Enhanced Additive Model</em>, and <strong>Loris</strong>,

<p> The instrument in Morphing Example 1 performs a sound morph between a clarinet
tone and a flute tone using reassigned bandwidth-enhanced partials stored in
"clarinet.sdif" and "flute.sdif."
<p>
The morph is performed over the sustain portions of the tones, 2. seconds
to 2.0 seconds in the case of the clarinet tone and .5 seconds to 2.1 seconds
in the case of the flute tone. The time index functions, <code>ktcl</code> and 
<code>ktfl</code>, align the onset and decay portions of the tones with
the specified onset and decay times for the morphed sound, specified by
parameters <code>p4</code> and <code>p5</code>, respectively. The onset
in the morphed sounds is purely clarinet partial data, and the decay is
purely flute data. The clarinet partials are shifted in pitch to match the
pitch of the flute tone (D above middle C).
<p>

The instrument in Morphing Example 2 performs a sound morph between a
flutter-tongued trombone tone and a cat's meow using reassigned
bandwidth-enhanced partials stored in "trombone.sdif" and "meow.sdif."
The data in these SDIF files have been channelized and distilled to
establish correspondences between partials.
<p>
The two sets of partials are imported and stored in memory locations
labeled 1 and 2, respectively. Both of the original sounds have four
notes, and the morph is performed over the second note in each sound
(from .75 to 1.2 seconds in the flutter-tongued trombone tone, and
from 1.7 to 2.2 seconds in the cat's meow). The different time index
functions, <code>kttbn</code> and <code></code>ktmeow, align those
segments of the source and target partial sets with the specified
morph start, morph end, and overall duration parameters. Two different
morphing functions are used, so that the partial ammplitudes and
bandwidth coefficients morph quickly from the trombone values to the
cat's-meow values, and the frequencies make a more gradual transition.
The morphed partials are stored in a memory location labeled 3 and
rendered by the subsequent <code>lorisplay</code> instruction. They
could also have been used as a source for another morph in a three-way
morphing instrument. The following score can be used to test both of
the instruments described above.
